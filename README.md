# Goals
To provide non-generic advice for people who intend on getting some sort work in the software development space.
Usually, it's for CS majors.

# Organization
As you might be looking for some specific topics to improve on, I'll be splitting some words up into various folders.
Maybe even subfolders too if documents end up getting too long.

# Presentation
Why a Git repo? Honestly, why not?
Maybe I'll migrate this to a personal website in the future, but I won't need to worry about formatting at all like this.
