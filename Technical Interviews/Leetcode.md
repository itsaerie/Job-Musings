## What's a Leetcode?
Leetcode is this website which provides common interview questions which may be asked in technical interviews. Similar websites are listed above.

###### Why does this matter?
There is no guarantee that every interview question asked will be on one of these sites,
but there are similarities between computer science problems and other programming problems:
questions aren't repeated verbatim, but underlying concepts (ie the F=m*a formula) will surely be repeated.
This is the main reason why people will say that Leetcode and other sites are a requirement for technical interview prep.

###### Differences with Interviews
Leetcode offers users to constantly run and debug your code.
However, during most technical interviews, you will not have the opportunity to run your code.
This functionality can promote a more brute-force mentality when trying to create a solution for your interview problem.
Check out the "ProblemSolving.md" file in the same directory for assistance on not-brute-force solutions.

Leetcode is also a solo practice platform, meaning that the only items involved are you and your program.
No need to try to explain what you're doing; no opportunity to ask or be asked questions; no one to give you hints.
A majority of technical interviews, whether they are done via phone, video call, or in person, require you to communicate with your interviewer throughout the entire interview.
Check out the "Communicating.md" file in the same directory for more info on communicating with others.
