# Communicating
You've heard the jokes and you've seen the memes.
People in tech or in engineering are often the butt of jokes which claim that we have poor social skills.
Regretfully, a lot of the time, these jokes are correct.
There may be a variety of different issues for each person, but here are a few very common and actionable ones:

### Jargon

Nobody wants to look stupid, right?
It's a common line of thinking that when you speak, **big words = smart**.
You might already know this, but it's certainly not true.


There are plenty of flaws with jargon, but the scariest one is that jargon leads us to making many assumptions about a person.
For example, you might think that every rocket scientist knows about the different layers of the earth's atmosphere,
but a rocket scientist that deals solely with chemistry might not know the difference between the Thermosphere and Ionosphere.
(Seeing as the Ionosphere is actually a [secondary layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Other_layers)).
And simply by listening to this, you might consider the author as someone pretentious and think to yourself,
"How am I supposed to know the difference? I'm no rocket scientist!"
And you would certainly be correct! What's the point of using jargon if your audience does not understand what you're saying?


What does jargon say about you during your interview?
- Perhaps you're pretentious. Maybe you just want to show off to whoever is interviewing you because you're *so* much better than everyone else.
- You make assumptions about people. So what if your interviewer hasn't heard of GCJ? Not everyone uses Java.
- You're not used to explaining things. It's as if the interviewer asked you why you chose option A over B and your only explanation was "Because A".
- You like making things complicated. Some pieces of jargon (ie "stack") can mean multiple different things and have multiple different definitions.

#### Jargon - How do we fix it?

Stop using jargon! *Well, yes, of course, it would be great if we just magically stopped.*


**Introduce Jargon before use**

If you struggle with not using the jargon, just define it beforehand.
I wouldn't personally recommend doing this because it's the most non-solution solution, but it's a great last resort!


**Practice explaining concepts**

Yes, it's super vague.
I found teaching others to be a great way to solidify both my knowledge and my presentation ability for various, more complicated concepts.
I would strongly suggest that you at least attempt the same!
There's plenty of ways to try doing so without the time commitment of full-blown teaching:
- Volunteer (or paid) Tutoring
- Helping out in community Discords
- Answering classmates' questions (ie on Canvas, maybe not in class)
- Teaching someone who knows nothing (ie parents or high school students)


**Find alternate explanations**
A mental macro of "find" and "replace" can work pretty well in avoiding jargon.

### Crashing your Train of Thought

*How to be a functional human being..?*

A major focus point of technical interviews is how you explain your solutions while writing them.
Whether the focus is more on your solution or on your explanation depends on the interviewer and the company which you're interviewing for.
Of course, this doesn't apply solely to the interview setting; being able to clearly communicate your thoughts is a key to good collaboration in the workplace (and ingame).

When it comes to communicating clearly with your interviewer, there are some key points which can be recognized from public speaking.
Enunciation is important, sure, but that's not what you're here for.
How about posture and eye contact? Those don't work for online interviews.
What we need are ways to take what's in our head, and then bring it to life, on paper or in stereo.

#### Ways to communicate well

**Stream of Consciousness**

My personal favorite is the stream of consciousness. [fun read](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323322454_Relationship_between_Stream_of_Consciousness_and_Disintegration_in_20th_Century_Literature)

It's a strange way of communicating which is usually interpreted as "saying what you think out loud."
This is a extremely straightforward approach where you can explain each part of your solution as you come up with it, and it allows your interviewer to ask questions if they are confused.

I'm not a particular fan of being unfiltered, but you can always filter out particularly dangerous thoughts that would get your interview cancelled. \*cough\*
There's no way that I can think of that can really "teach" saying what's on your mind, but you could practice in some places where massive amounts of thought occur.
Such as in the bathroom or during a shower. (Don't do it at night, please be mindful of the people around you!)

**Todo Lists**

If you're an organized person, you might do better with a heavily methodical approach.
As such, I'll present this in a list format.

1. Take a step back and organize your thoughts.
This is especially important during interviews where you'd want to find an approach to the solution after asking a few clarifying questions.
You may also wish to notify your interviewer that you're taking a bit of time to collect and organize some thoughts.
2. Make a little "To-Do" list. (If you ever had the problem regarding making a [peanut butter sandwich](http://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/team-activities/ProgrammingPeanutButterAndJelly.pdf), it's like that.
Otherwise, this is a very incredible read.)
3. Explain each step in your preferred manner.
Whether this manner is writing it out with ASCII-like examples, or through verbal gymnastics, explain each step of your solution one step at a time.
Remember to confirm understanding on each step! (Hopefully, there's not great leaps of logic before each step as each step should have a 'purpose'.)
If you have trouble formulating these steps, please refer to the __ProblemSolving.md__ file in the same folder.

##### Extra frequently encountered issues

Stutterring or using filler words or "uhh" or "hmm" or "aaaaaaaaaaAAAAA"
- Speak loudly!
- Posture check (no, seriously).
