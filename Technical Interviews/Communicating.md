# Communicating
You've heard the jokes and you've seen the memes.
People in tech or in engineering are often the butt of jokes which claim that we have poor social skills.
Regretfully, a lot of the time, these jokes are correct.
There may be a variety of different issues for each person, but here are a few very common and actionable ones:

### Jargon

Nobody wants to look stupid, right?
It's a common line of thinking that when you speak, **big words = smart**.
You might already know this, but it's certainly not true.


There are plenty of flaws with jargon, but the scariest one is that jargon leads us to making many assumptions about a person.
For example, you might think that every rocket scientist knows about the different layers of the earth's atmosphere,
but a rocket scientist that deals solely with chemistry might not know the difference between the Thermosphere and Ionosphere.
(Seeing as the Ionosphere is actually a [secondary layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Other_layers)).
And simply by listening to this, you might consider the author as someone pretentious and think to yourself,
"How am I supposed to know the difference? I'm no rocket scientist!"
And you would certainly be correct! What's the point of using jargon if your audience does not understand what you're saying?


What does jargon say about you during your interview?
- Perhaps you're pretentious. Maybe you just want to show off to whoever is interviewing you because you're *so* much better than everyone else.
- You make assumptions about people. So what if your interviewer hasn't heard of GCJ? Not everyone uses Java.
- You're not used to explaining things. It's as if the interviewer asked you why you chose option A over B and your only explanation was "Because A".
- You like making things complicated. Some pieces of jargon (ie "stack") can mean multiple different things and have multiple different definitions.

#### How do we fix it?

Stop using jargon! *Well, yes, of course, it would be great if we just magically stopped.*


**Introduce Jargon before use**

If you struggle with not using the jargon, just define it beforehand.
I wouldn't personally recommend doing this because it's the most non-solution solution, but it's a great last resort!


**Practice explaining concepts**

Yes, it's super vague.
I found teaching others to be a great way to solidify both my knowledge and my presentation ability for various, more complicated concepts.
I would strongly suggest that you at least attempt the same!
There's plenty of ways to try doing so without the time commitment of full-blown teaching:
- Volunteer (or paid) Tutoring
- Helping out in community Discords
- Answering classmates' questions (ie on Canvas, maybe not in class)
- Teaching someone who knows nothing (ie parents or high school students)
