# Career Fair

# The W's (not Win, sorry)

### What is that?

A career fair is, for most, something that we can lovingly call "an apply online simulator". Historically, a career fair was meant to match prospective employees with companies in a weighted speed-dating-esque setting. Companies will set up tables or booths, and people (students, usually) will line up for a short 1-5 minute chat with a recruiter or an employee. The typical dialogue will be covered later in this guide, but it often ends with the prospective employee giving a paper copy of his/her resume and the recruiter advising the employee-to-be to apply online. Occasionally, smaller companies or more personable recruiters will actually note down contact information or provide contact information, but your contact information (as a prospective hire) should always be on your resume. (Resume advice provided separately.)

### Why should we care?

Disclaimer: I have *zero* insight into all companies present at a career fair and do not claim to do so.

The main reason why you would want to go to a career fair is, obviously, to try to get a job. Whether it's an internship or a full-time position, a career fair isn't a bad place to go to apply to companies and show them that you care. For example, if you have a history of "repping" (slang for "representing") a company in an unofficial and positive manner, it's pretty likely that you might be documented for doing so. Additionally, there's the merit of the people that you meet during the career fair being likely to be involved in their hiring process for your "batch" (school or region or whatever flavor career fair it is), and it is in your best interest to make a positive impression on the people who decide whether you are to be hired or not. Finally, for those uninterested in jobs, career fairs are great places for free merch: you only need to wait in line for minutes to get random free goodies, such as (but not guaranteed) laptop camera covers, pop sockets, bookmarks, rulers, and more.

# Planning for the Fair

### The Hitlist

Most career fairs will give you or have available a list of expected companies that will show up on site. We should be realistic and realize that we won't have time for all of them and probably not even half of them. As such, it's worthwhile to take an hour or two and go through the entire list of companies in attendance and strike off certain ones who are worthy of a friendly 'visit'.

So which companies deserve a visit and which don't? That depends heavily on whether you have a goal or career path in mind or not.

##### A Specialist Warpath

If you have a discipline in mind and a focal point, then that's great! You should definitely first filter all the companies down to the companies that you'd want to work for in a professional capacity, for whatever role you're intending to work as. For example, a software engineer might filter the hitlist down to solely companies known for their technological advancements or known to work purely in computer-related fields. However, specialization means that there's a risk of finding a very low amount of companies directly tied to a desired field, so it could be a good idea to expand to tangentially related fields if the hitlist isn't enough to fill your whole day.

##### The Goalless One

It's a little bit more difficult to go to a career fair without a specialization in mind. Still, it's good to generate a list of companies that sound appealing to work for and to rule out the companies or positions you would absolutely refuse to work for. That should at least narrow it down. Otherwise, it might be a good idea to limit the count of big brand name companies (the ones even your grandparents know) down to maybe 5-20% of your final list. Note that the hitlist should be doable within the allotted career fair duration.

### A Star

Hopefully, your career fair planners have included a map with the various booths/tables that each company is expected to be at. **Print this map out.** If not, try your best to find a map of the venue, at the minimum. With your map, you will want to mark down the locations and/or names of each company's table that you want to visit. This can be done in whatever preferred notetaking method you have, be it different shapes or colors for each marking, but what's important is to have this information marked off of your handheld device (paper is reliable, free WiFi and 4/5G is not when in crowded areas).

Now, there is the possibility to attempt A* or some other pathfinding mechanism to solve your very own TSP (travelling salesperson) situation, but it's really not worth it. There are a lot of weights to each destination, such as attractiveness (how much you want to work at a company) and popularity (how big the lines are, so how much time is spent waiting). Personal recommendation is to keep the large companies for the beginning or end of your time at the career fair; the smaller companies often leave early or arrive late, and lines are always going to be smaller at the start and end because of how people are- arriving late or leaving early.
