Hi! I'm aerie and I'm the primary author of this.
I've promised to write an amount of hours based on reactions to a specific unnamed Discord post:
- Currently 0/14

I'm not really going to go too much into my own background for a couple reasons.

tl;dr
If I were to mention work history, you would know the place where I have worked.
If I were to mention job offers (for some reason?), you'd know some of the notable ones.

The primary reason is that I don't believe that anyone should follow my words without forming an opinion.
For example, if a FAANG employee were to provide some "interview advice", that advice might work really well for them, but not work well for others.
Regardless, people will religiously and blindly follow such advice as it's from a "FAANG" employee so...
I don't think that it's productive. I don't think it promotes thought.

Next, I don't know if this will be shared, but I'm okay if this ends up being shared because it's helpful for people.

Hopefully, this helps someone at least.
