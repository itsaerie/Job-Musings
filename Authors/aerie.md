Hi! I'm **aerie** and I'm the primary author of this.
I've promised to write an amount of hours based on reactions to a specific unnamed Discord post:
:Removed the number of hours because I'm unable to count to 5.

Basically a CS major. Has worked at one or two notable places.
> I'm not really going to go too much into my own background for a couple reasons.

The primary reason is that **I don't believe that anyone should follow my words without forming an opinion for themselves.**
For example, if a FAANG employee were to provide some "interview advice", that advice might work really well for them, but not work well for others.
Regardless, people will religiously and blindly follow such advice as it's from a "FAANG" employee so...
I don't think that it's productive. I don't think it promotes thought.

Next, I don't know if this will be shared, but I'm okay if this ends up being shared because it's helpful for people.

Hopefully, this helps someone at least.
