# Experience

### What does Experience mean?
'Experience' is an intentionally broad term which, in this case, should refer to anything you've done with skills realted to the job you're applying for.
Usually, when people think about resumes, they mention only **Work Experience**, but, as students, you probably don't have much experience related to the field.
You might even be applying for your first job in your entire life!
Some other forms of 'experience' may come as **Volunteering**, which doesn't only mean building houses in a third world country (as admirable as this may be).
**Volunteering** could refer to things such as tutoring or helping out at a local library.
And one more kind of experience sought out is **Leadership Experience**, which broadly includes any kind of leadership experience which you've had in the past.

### Why do they want my experience?
You hear a lot of people mention that they'd rather you don't list X experiences for Y reasons, but they usually give some sort of incomplete reasoning.

** TODO: Find industry reviewers for this. **

By itself, an experience can provide a qualitative and quantitative perspective on you.
Quantitatively, one can gather many different metrics just from the job title and date:
- What sorts of responsibilities has this person gotten?
- How much should I be paying this person based on experience?
- How much experience does this person have in this field from this work?
- What kind of impact did this person bring to their workplace?
Qualitative features require some reading in, and will heavily differ depending on the kind of recruiter you have:
- Has this person succeeded or excelled in this job?
- Can I expect this person to be a changing factor, or to just function as "another worker"?

Because recruiters may read into your resume quite a lot, you're going to want to use your resume to paint yourself in the best light.
Not only should you be accurate and provide facts which can be proven if the hiring manager wishes to do a background check,
but you can also promote yourself by giving detailed and colorful descriptions of your experiences.

# Flavors of Experience
I've touched upon this a little bit earlier in this page, but this will be a more in depth talk about the different flavors of experience and why you should use each one.
Or why you shouldn't.
Space is a commodity on your resume.

### Work Experience
Clearly, the most relevant experiences are the best experiences to put onto your resume.
That said, which ones are most relevant to add in?
Actually, do we even have relevant work experiences?

Considering that current students usually don't have many other experiences, any previous

### Formatting
What's important in every experience?
Always include the title of your role, name of the company/group/team/whatever where you were at, and the date range where you existed there.
These provide an important amount of quantitative metrics that every company will want to look for.

As for the details and description of your resume, there are two main styling formats used, paragraphs and bullet points.
I advocate heavily for bullet point usage where each bullet point is a sentence (or independent clause, if you want to be technical).
As many recruiters only skim resumes, having large blocks of text usually translate into "time wasted" and can be easily ignored.

### Effective Content
*Ah, K.I.S.S. 'Keep It Simple, Stupid'*

Keep your content brief and get to the point.
