# Experience

### What does Experience mean?
'Experience' is an intentionally broad term which, in this case, should refer to anything you've done with skills realted to the job you're applying for.
Usually, when people think about resumes, they mention only **Work Experience**, but, as students, you probably don't have much experience related to the field.
You might even be applying for your first job in your entire life!
Some other forms of 'experience' may come as **Volunteering**, which doesn't only mean building houses in a third world country (as admirable as this may be).
**Volunteering** could refer to things such as tutoring or helping out at a local library.
And one more kind of experience sought out is **Leadership Experience**, which broadly includes any kind of leadership experience which you've had in the past.

### Why do they want my experience?
You hear a lot of people mention that they'd rather you don't list X experiences for Y reasons, but they usually give some sort of incomplete reasoning.

** TODO: Find industry reviewers for this. **

By itself, an experience can provide a qualitative and quantitative perspective on you.
Quantitatively, one can gather many different metrics just from the job title and date:
- What sorts of responsibilities has this person gotten?
- How much should I be paying this person based on experience?
- How much experience does this person have in this field from this work?
- What kind of impact did this person bring to their workplace?
Qualitative features require some reading in, and will heavily differ depending on the kind of recruiter you have:
- Has this person succeeded or excelled in this job?
- Can I expect this person to be a changing factor, or to just function as "another worker"?

Because recruiters may read into your resume quite a lot, you're going to want to use your resume to paint yourself in the best light.
Not only should you be accurate and provide facts which can be proven if the hiring manager wishes to do a background check,
but you can also promote yourself by giving detailed and colorful descriptions of your experiences.

# Flavors of Experience
I've touched upon this a little bit earlier in this page, but this will be a more in depth talk about the different flavors of experience and why you should use each one.
Or why you shouldn't.
Space is a commodity on your resume.

For general content advisory, view the "Effective Content" section far below.

### Work Experience
Clearly, the most relevant experiences are the best experiences to put onto your resume.
That said, which ones are most relevant to add in?
Actually, do we even have relevant work experiences?

### Other Internships (or Tech Experiences)
Considering that current students usually don't have many other experiences, any previous internships should have top priority.
And within that subset, you should prioritize the most well-known companies and the most important positions you've held.
(This may be easy, as almost all of these positions involve the word "intern".)

### Non-tech Job Experience
Of course, retail is a great way to show that you have and have had a solid work ethic in general, but I'd recommend keeping the details on these to a minimum.
I'd also warn slightly against filling your resume with these, rather than filling your resume with projects.
It's kind of like a diet, it's nice to have a good, balanced resume, and non-tech job experiences are just about the closest to excess foods you can get.
(Note that the actual reason why I recommend against bloating your resume with many different job experiences is because sometimes it can be taken as 'inconcsistency',
meaning that a company might not want you back after working for them once or that you might not like working at the same place once.)

Second note that I recommend avoiding details because, let's face it, they're superfluous and do little to nothing for a tech position.
Sure, being able to shelve items properly is a responsibility, but programming takes item shelving to a different scale because of database management or access.
Similarly, it's nice to showcase that you have good peer-to-peer skills, but you can display them outside of your resume.
Take, for example, if someone were to walk up to you and tell you that they're a great conversationalist and a super humble person.
They could, potentially, be telling the truth, but I wouldn't want to continue talking to said person as long as I have better option.
The same logic applies here.

### Hackathons and Programming Events
This can refer to Hackathons, CTF events, etc. Double points if you can mention that you won an award too.
(Let me know if you'd like a document to expand on hackathons and other events.)

Participating in a hackathon is a really cool thing.
Not only are you demonstrating how quickly you can work on some project within a limited time span,
but you're also showing that you have a passion for programming and a love for the field to the point where you're entering random competitions regarding programming.
You're so cool, aren't you!
These events are also a great way to segue topic from a resume into an interview.
Some common behavioral questions may ask you about experiences with past projects, hard deadlines, or favorite projects and, luckily, these events are a perfect fit for those.

### Volunteering
Volunteering is wonderful! It demonstrates that you have character, which is always something that companies **prefer**.
I say prefer because the list of job prerequisites doesn't usually include the words "Is a nice person."
However, some forms of volunteering are more relevant to technical jobs than others.
Teaching high school kids how to program in Scratch is more relevant than the physical labor of building homes in a third world country.
It's not to belittle the people who do go out and build homes in a third world country, but volunteering experience is usually not as highly regarded.
(That, and resume parsers generally won't care about how much you embraces local culture.)

### Leadership Experience
Leadership is an important trait, I think.
I'm not really sure why companies look for it if you're not directly seeking some sort of leadership position, ie a Project Manager or Team Lead role.
If you know more and would like to enlighten me on how I can better promote this part of "Experience", please shoot me a DM or open an issue!

### Other Club Experience
List this under your education.
Sorry, but that's where it belongs.

# General Advisory

### Formatting
What's important in every experience?
Always include the title of your role, name of the company/group/team/whatever where you were at, and the date range where you existed there.
These provide an important amount of quantitative metrics that every company will want to look for.

As for the details and description of your resume, there are two main styling formats used, paragraphs and bullet points.
I advocate heavily for bullet point usage where each bullet point is a sentence (or independent clause, if you want to be technical).
As many recruiters only skim resumes, having large blocks of text usually translate into "time wasted" and can be easily ignored.

## Effective Content
*Ah, K.I.S.S. 'Keep It Simple, Stupid'*

Keep your content brief and get to the point.
If your content can be simplified, then simplify it!
Remember, your recruiters are people too and they have a ton of resumes to get through, so you should keep it brief and get to the point.

That said, how should we keep our content brief?

### Trim Excess Fa(c)ts
These experiences should focus on important metrics that are either quantifiable (your recruiter will be impressed) or qualifiable (the parsing software will be impressed).

Take a second to consider what your description is adding to your resume as a whole.
Are you adding some new skills?
Are you establishing your qualified expertise in some skill or job?
Is this something relevant for the position you're applying to?
Does this show how well you performed your job (objectively)?
If you can't answer "Yes" with 100% certainty to any of these questions, you should remove that description.

If you're using a multi-sentence description or descriptions with multiple bullet points, you should ask those questions for each sentence/point.

### Adding Metrics
Now that you've trimmed off extra, unneeded details, you can move on to adding important metrics to help make your skills quantifiable.
What are metrics?
They are these pretty numbers that you can add to your resume (which should be backed by fact) that help make your achievement more colorful and quantifiable.
Some alright examples might be:
- \>95% accuracy for data analysis/ML/AI
- improved workflows of 50,000 developers
- grew user base from 500 to 25000

TODO : Find the actual, pretty formatting for metrics. Also find some better metrics examples.

My memory only kept "Worked on X, using Y, to achieve Z."
- X is the project or goal you worked on.
- Y is the technology or technologies you used.
- Z is a metric.

For example, referring to this (if I were doing this as a part of an experience), I would have a bullet point on a resume saying,
"Worked on Job Musings using Markdown, to assist 5% of CS/IT majors of NJIT."

### Demonstrating Proficiency
How do we show off what we know while making sure they know about us knowing what we know that they might not know?
That question may not make sense, but this is the kind of stuff that recruiters might see on resumes, for people that want to really show off.
So how do we turn our technobabble into readable English?

- Avoid jargon as much as possible.

Excess use of jargon only helps confuse people. There's no need to overly complicate things by saying something like,
"I warped the jump-cable via ISB-NET 4 through an Damascus unobtanium alloy to conjugate the multi-layered RNN with LSTM priorities."
If that looked like mumbo-jumbo, then you know why recruiters (who are often not well-versed in tech) might not enjoy your use of jargon.
I'd recommend that you try limiting the use of jargon to the more common terms: well-known languages, tools, and technologies.

- Remember what tools are.

Don't express your experience as "worked in Language".
Sorry to say, but it doesn't show anything if you only say that you worked in a certain language.
Remember that languages are tools, and that your achievements in a language can demonstrate your prowess.
As an example, it's a stronger argument to say that you "built the framework to parse and interpret a language using C++"
compared to saying that you "worked in C++ to parse and interpret code".

### Grammar
Use proper and formal English (or whatever language your resume is written in).

Weak grammar is, well, weak. A resume is definitely a formal document, so you should try to use formal language.
