# Skills
Adding a skills section to your resume is a pretty great way to add a bunch of keywords to your resume.

### What to add?
What kinds of skills should you even add to your resume?

Actually, what even are the skills that your recruiters will care about?
Microsoft Office is pretty common as a skill that gets listed on normal resumes, but we're (hopefully) looking for something a little bit past that, so let's ignore Office.
Really, what we want to do is decide on which technical skills and which soft skills are important for us.

The technical skills we want to mention certainly include programming languages (C, Java, Python, etc) and can also be extended to include well-known libraries (Angular, React, Tensorflow, etc).
Depending on where you're applying to, you can also add on some more niche libraries if you believe them to be relevant for the job which you're applying for.

Some odd technical skills which could be worth adding would be ones involving specific job-related software such as Unity or Unreal Engine for game development, or maybe Photoshop and Sony Vegas for multimedia-related work.

It's vague to add specific buzzwords such as "cloud computing" or "machine learning" instead of the libraries implemented, but I do not have any knowledge nor experience on what companies prefer in that regard. (Please open a Git issue or contact me directly if you have input!)

As for soft skills, they don't really have a place on resumes if not to fill out even more space on your resume. (At least in my opinion.)
But if you're interested in including "soft skills", then common ones are the team-related and communication-related ones, such as *Good Communication* and *Great Team Player*.
Again, these essentially will add nothing to your resume that won't be covered during any of your interviews, so I suggest against adding them at all.
(Yes, it is correct that retail and various part-time jobs like those words because they are pretty, but then again, those jobs usually hire just about anyone.)

### Get Good
How good do you have to be at a skill to add it to your resume even?

It's really objective here, but a bunch of people add in skills where they've only taken a single class remotely related to the skill.
As someone seeking internships or entry-level positions, you can expect that to be a satisfactory level of skill to display on your resume.

### Presentation
Listing or what? Grouping? Got a whole bunch of skills here, how do I show them off?

Generally, people just list out all of their skills in any old way: using bullet points or separating them with commas in one big block of text.

Grouping is also a possibility, where you group similar skills together: programming languages, libraries, etc. These groupings don't need to be explicitly labeled as they can be labeled implicitly.

Sorting your skills can also be done.
It's most common to simply put them in alphabetical order, but if you use a different organization for your skills, you should specify that somewhere so you don't seem disorganized.
Personally, I prefer to list them in order of confidence (which I write as 'fluency'), but you can do whatever resonates with you best.

# Relevant Coursework
Otherwise known as "Pack Filler" (it's a joke about Trading Card Games).

Your relevant coursework is your ultimate replacement for the experiences you may be missing.
Usually, if you don't have relevant work experience or any work experience, you could dump in your relevant coursework and still have a text-filled resume that contains important information for your recruiter!
Additionally, this is a great item to add to just fill out that last inch or two of whitespace if your resume has some at the bottom still.

### What do I put?
No, do not put Course IDs by themselves. (Don't list CS100, CS101, )
Schools can have different progressions of courses, excepting that a "100" or "101" course is considered to be basic.

Try and find your course title (you can usually find it on the same page where you register for classes).
If you're really insistent on taking up more space with each relevant course, then you can add the course ID either before or after the course title.

### What is Relevant?
This is a pretty difficult question, isn't it?

> Small niche here that if your resume is still essentially empty at this point, all courses which are considered requirements for your major can be considered relevant.
Of course, just make sure to feature the ones most pertinent to your major first (ie Computer Science courses for CS majors, then Math/Science next).

If the above statement doesn't apply to you, then let's get to figuring out what courses are most relevant.
The most relevant courses for your major that you'd want to feature are usually the ones with the same ID as your major (ie CS101 for CS majors) and the highest-level ones (ie senior-level > freshman-level) as the higher level courses touch even more job-relevant content.
After going through all of your major-related courses, if you still want to add more, you'll want to add the fields which support your major best. For Computer Science and Information Technology majors, these are usually your required Math courses as well as some science courses. (Your school might require you take a high-level math such as Linear Algebra or Differential Equations, which are very nice additions.)

### Descriptions
How do we turn a course from a phrase to a phrase PLUS a sentence?

Sometimes you can just copy-paste what your professor's description of the course is from your syllabus. It's usually short, sweet, and to-the-point!

Otherwise, you can describe your course in your own words, but remember to keep it short and simple wherever possible.

# Other Links
I highly recommend adding other related links on your resume.
This can be as simple as a LinkedIn page or your GitHub profile, but can also expand to include things such as your personal website or a different portfolio/compilation of your projects.
If you think there's a project that should be listed here, ask yourself why you haven't included it in your Experience/Projects section. If it's already there, then leave the link as is!
