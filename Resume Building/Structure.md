# The Usual Structure of a Resume
*Relatively in order*

-----
# General Organization

### Don't be (THAT) Different
First off, remember to **conform**.
It's strange advice, to say that your resume should visually seem like many other resumes, but there are some merits.
And it's not like you need to rely on some visual gimmicks for a company to realize that you should be *considered* for a position, right? *Right? ...hahaha...*
The biggest reason for conforming to a more standard resume look isn't just for the recruiters' sake.
This is something which I will be referring to many times in the future, the fact that almost all companies today use resume parsing software during their hiring process.
In short, this software takes the *image* or *pdf* of your resume and tries to extract useful data from that resume.
If you've attempted to convert a pdf document to a Microsoft word document, you're hopefully aware of how dreadful the recognition software is at this time.
Expect your resume to be passed through that, or worse.

### One Page
The 'best' average resume is a single-page resume.
Single page is sweet, simple, and easy for everyone (except maybe you).
During in-person events, handing a recruiter a single piece of paper is more convenient for that recruiter who could be receiving hundreds of other resumes.
Your resume will always be in one piece, with no chance of losing a page of your resume randomly.
Not only that, but you also won't need to worry about how you keep your pages together: stapling, paper clipping, binding, or whatnot.
Also, please don't even consider doding "one page, front and back."
Even as diligent students, we sometimes miss when an exam has a reverse side with additional questions, don't we?
It would be presumptuous of us to assume that a recruiter will always look for a reverse side when hundreds of other resumes are missing a reverse side.

### Basic Formatting
As mentioned above, your resume will be passed into a parsing (image to text) software.
I'd recommend, at most, using two different fonts.
Having more fonts might throw off the parsing software and induce false typos in your parsed resume.
As for font sizes, aside from your header, you're going to want to be able to differentiate between your content titles (ie school, work position/place, project name) and the content description (ie GPA, responsibilities/achievements, technologies used).

### File Name
Please use your name when naming your resume.
If your resume is being emailed to a recruiter with the name "*Resume.pdf*", you can expect it to be thrown into a folder of a hundred different files, named "Resume (1).pdf", "Resume (2).pdf", etc.
Congratulations, your resume is "Resume (101).pdf"! This should be the exact opposite of what you want your resume to do, to turn you into a number.

# Content Intro
Well, sure, it's nice to know how to organize a resume, but what should I put on it?

## Who are you?
Put this section at the TOP of your resume, no matter what.
No if's, and's, or's, or but's.
Remember, this piece of paper is about you. Own it.

- Name.
Your name is the first this that the reader should see, and the thing that the reader should be able to easily find when communicating with you.

- Email.
That said, you definitely need to add methods of communication.
These methods used to prioritize a phone number over an email, but, given the current setting and the fact that you're looking for something related to tech (probably), your email is the number one priority.
The email you use should be as professional as possible.
Think about it, would you rather email someone at "aer17@institute.edu" or email something like "xXxPr0H4ck3rxXx42069@gmail.com"?
Not only is the second option objectively *cringe*, but it makes you look extremely unprofessional. Congrats.

- Phone.
It probably doesn't need to be mentioned, but any phone number that you're reachable by works.
If finding a job is important to you, put in your cell. It's not like anyone uses a home phone number anymore anyways. Heh.

Now for the more unconventional methods of contact.

- Git.
When you have a job that focuses on developing software, it's partly assumed by many companies that an applicant would have a Github account, if not just for school.
Source control is pretty important.
Similarly, if you have too many projects to list or you just want to link to all of your projects at once, you can share your Github profile like a portfolio.
You can, potentially, change the display name or the real-life data behind your Github account to make it "appear" more professional, but it's fine if your Github doesn't show any personal information.
It's okay to be paranoid about information sharing in this one case.

- Personal Links.
Just like how your Github account can be used as a portfolio, you can use personal links to projects or even to your own website as a portfolio!

And the completely extra things that only a few places ask for.

- Address.
Noone does snail mail anyways, but enough apparently exist that some companies might ask you for your address upfront.
It's dated, but it's something that you can share if you are comfortable sharing.

- Preferred Work Location.
Even more rare than asking for an address, a preferred work location is...
Strange.
I personally wouldn't even consider mentioning one.

## Education
When applying for internships or new college graduate positions, this is the next most important thing after your info.
It's almost guaranteed that a company will ask you for your date of graduation and a transcript to verify these too.

List each school separately, with the most important things first.
Usually, this means that you should put your most recent school closer to the top, and your least recent education lowest.

The key pieces of information here are:
- Name of School
- Degree and Major Attmpting (ie B.S. Computer Science)
- Dates (usually, start MM/YY to end MM/YY. The date of graduation is extremely important when applying as a student.)
- GPA (* see below)

Personally, I wouldn't put in a GPA below 3.5 as anything else isn't really worth showing off, and companies that care about GPA will ask you anyways.
Some people have a personal rule of not showing a GPA below X, so just go with your heart if you believe that I am incorrect.

## Experiences
This can be "Work Experience" or "Volunteering" or "Side project experience".

If you're still a student, there's a high chance that this is mostly empty.
Fear not, there's the __Experience.md__ file just for that purpose!
(There's too much to say to include it in this file.)

## Projects
It's hard to say how important this section really is or whether this section really is that important when you can just link a portfolio.
But really, there's a lot to consider and a lot to write here

If you're still a student, there's a high chance that this is mostly empty.
Fear not, there's the __Projects.md__ file just for that purpose!
(There's way too much to say to include it in this file.)

## Skills
A bucket list which should only include skills which you are okay receiving questions with.
Depending on what you're applying for, be mindful that the skills that you list are important and appropiate for the role which you want.
For example, if you're looking to be a Full Stack Developer, please refrain from listing "Microsoft Office" as one of your best skills...
Instead, you'd want to feature various technologies for both the frontend and backend development. (ie MySQL and JS).

Personally, I list mine in order of confidence, and I make a special note that it's in descending order of most confident first.
Regardless, as long as your skills are organized in an intuitive way, the section is a great way to put a ton of "buzzwords" into your resume quickly.

## Related Coursework
Similar to skills, but I'd only recommend including this section if you have nothing in Experiences or Projects.
This field should showcase any super interesting courses that you believe showcase an exemplary ability/skill or feature an interesting and unique project.
