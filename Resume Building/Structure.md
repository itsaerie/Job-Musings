# The Usual Structure of a Resume
*Relatively in order*

The 'best' average resume is a single-page resume.
Single page is the best

## Who are you?
REQUIRED: Name, Email
Highly preferred: Phone, Personal Links, Github, Preferred work location
Extra: Address

## Education
School, major, GPA (if higher than 3.0)

Personally, I wouldn't put in a GPA below 3.5 as anything else isn't really worth showing off, and companies that care about GPA will ask you anyways.

## Experiences
This can be "Work Experience" or "Volunteering" or "Side project experience"

## Projects
It's hard to say how important this section really is or whether this section really is that important when you can just link a portfolio.

## Skills
A bucket list which should only include skills which you are okay receiving questions with.
