# Projects
Ah, so you do the programming thing, eh?

Projects are a great way for you to better connect with those who are looking at you.
I've mentioned previously that resumes are indeed formal documents, but your projects section can really help bring out your personality and your uniqueness.
The coolest and most exciting projects are passion projects, and that's usually what people put onto their resumes.
And everyone can have different passions. Even if they are the same passion, it can spawn many different projects.
This section is where you can give your recruiters and interviewers a taste of your personality.

### Passion Projects

##### Starting a new Passion Project

- The Idea
First off, what are you passionate about?
Maybe take a minute and think about how you spend your days off.

Do you spend time drawing or writing?
Maybe AI-based generation would be a cool way to start!
You could also create a website as a portfolio for your works.
Or get into a slightly more difficult medium like animation or 3D art.

Do you spend time playing games?
Why not optimize your gameplay?
You can formulate strategies, build tools, get into modding, or even reverse engineer the entire game!
Lots of people learn how to program because of video games, and game modding has an incredible amount of documentation.
Data miners make tool building and strategy crafting easy.
And decompilers help with taking the game apart.

No matter what you spend time doing, there's potential for you to turn your attraction into a project.
And don't feel too pressured to think of any project immediately.
Inspiration strikes randomly, and sometime those ideas are amazing and deserve to be saved for when you're out of the shower!

- The Motivation
This is a bit of time for introspection.
Why have you not done a passion project yet?

Have you done many projects before, but never completed any?
This might not be your first rodeo then, but maybe it's an issue with personal motivation and goal setting.
If that's the case, I strongly recommend giving [this video by CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) a watch.

Are you unable to bring yourself to do it because you can't hold yourself accountable?
Find someone trustworthy and motivated that likes you enough to work on a project with you!
This concept called [mutual accountability](https://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/49656340.pdf) helps keep you on track to hit deadlines, similarly to how they work in the real world.

Have you not had "the perfect idea"?
Projects don't have to be perfect.
In fact, they're never perfect.
There's always going to be something to change, something to alter, no matter how small that thing is.
You can see this very prominently in a similar field- entrepreneurship.
Changing that "perfect idea" happens so often that "pivoting" is a common piece of jargon used, even outside of the entrepreneurship space.
Even in programming, we constantly use the terms "debugging" and "troubleshooting" as parts of the software development lifecycle.
Don't beat yourself up thinking that everything has to be perfect.

Congratulations, I hope you've decided to do a passion project now.

- The Framework

### Schoolwork as Projects
You are a boring person.
Just hope that your recruiter does not receive multiple resumes from the same school or they'll know that something is up with all of these strikingly-similar-yet-probably-not-plagiarized projects.

### Non-technical Projects
Honestly, I wouldn't know.
If it's something that's grown and succeeded enough to the point where it makes you money, why is it counted as a "Project" and not an "Experience"?
