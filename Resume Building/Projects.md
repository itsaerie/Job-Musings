# Projects
Ah, so you do the programming thing, eh?

Projects are a great way for you to better connect with those who are looking at you.
I've mentioned previously that resumes are indeed formal documents, but your projects section can really help bring out your personality and your uniqueness.
The coolest and most exciting projects are passion projects, and that's usually what people put onto their resumes.
And everyone can have different passions. Even if they are the same passion, it can spawn many different projects.
This section is where you can give your recruiters and interviewers a taste of your personality.

Oh, and...
**It's OKAY to include projects in-progress!**

# Passion Projects
These are your coolest projects that you'll love enough to be about monologue all over your recruiter, interviewer, friends, and Uber drivers.

A passion project, essentially, is something that you think is cool enough that you want to spend some of your own personal time to work on it.
These are the kinds of projects that others will want to hear about, purely because they want to hear you talk about what you enjoy.
These ones are probably what you'll be most proud of, as well, since it's a project that is- you.

## Starting a new Passion Project

### The Idea
First off, what are you passionate about?
Maybe take a minute and think about how you spend your days off.

Do you spend time drawing or writing?
Maybe AI-based generation would be a cool way to start!
You could also create a website as a portfolio for your works.
Or get into a slightly more difficult medium like animation or 3D art.

Do you spend time playing games?
Why not optimize your gameplay?
You can formulate strategies, build tools, get into modding, or even reverse engineer the entire game!
Lots of people learn how to program because of video games, and game modding has an incredible amount of documentation.
Data miners make tool building and strategy crafting easy.
And decompilers help with taking the game apart.

No matter what you spend time doing, there's potential for you to turn your attraction into a project.
And don't feel too pressured to think of any project immediately.
Inspiration strikes randomly, and sometime those ideas are amazing and deserve to be saved for when you're out of the shower!

Or maybe there's some new technology that you'd want to showcase or learn.
Does that technology tie in with one of your hobbies?
Can it be used in a fun way that keeps you interested?

### The Motivation
This is a bit of time for introspection.
Why have you not done a passion project yet?

Have you done many projects before, but never completed any?
This might not be your first rodeo then, but maybe it's an issue with personal motivation and goal setting.
If that's the case, I strongly recommend giving [this video by CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) a watch.

Are you unable to bring yourself to do it because you can't hold yourself accountable?
Find someone trustworthy and motivated that likes you enough to work on a project with you!
This concept called [mutual accountability](https://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/49656340.pdf) helps keep you on track to hit deadlines, similarly to how they work in the real world.

Have you not had "the perfect idea"?
Projects don't have to be perfect.
In fact, they're never perfect.
There's always going to be something to change, something to alter, no matter how small that thing is.
You can see this very prominently in a similar field- entrepreneurship.
Changing that "perfect idea" happens so often that "pivoting" is a common piece of jargon used, even outside of the entrepreneurship space.
Even in programming, we constantly use the terms "debugging" and "troubleshooting" as parts of the software development lifecycle.
Don't beat yourself up thinking that everything has to be perfect.

Congratulations, I hope you've decided to do a passion project now.

### The Doing
There's a bunch of different ways to organize a passion project, and some might be for you and some might not.

If you've worked on a personal project before, you've probably encountered a few different ways of organizing your project.
There are some methods which promote productivity for certain people that just don't work for others.
If you find yourself stuck on a project and not being productive for over 2 weeks, I'd recommend trying a different strategy for your project.
What I'm listing below are just a few quick methods on how I've seen people organize projects.
Know more? Put in an issue and I'll add it.
- The TODO List. This comes in various varieties, and can be ordered or unordered.
My main issue with this is that unordered TODO lists end up messing with logical dependencies sometimes, but it's simple and straightforwards.
- The TODO Comments, scattered everywhere. If you're reading this before I call this repo "complete" then you've probably seen TODOs marked out in various files.
This is very unorganized, but I get the benefit of being able to run a short search and find what I have left TODO.
The main issue is... It's super unorganized and requires checking files constantly.
- Kanban Boards. Honestly, I'd just recommend you read about it, maybe from an [article](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum) or [something](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban-board).
It's super organized, but it personally feels like a project in itself. Which is kinda boring when you want to get productive.

# Schoolwork as Projects
You are a boring person.
Just hope that your recruiter does not receive multiple resumes from the same school or they'll know that something is up with all of these strikingly-similar-yet-probably-not-plagiarized projects.

But really, if the project details were specified in a lot of detail by your professor to the point where your project looks exactly like another classmate's project, I would warn against including said project.
I suppose that it should be okay to do so if you have zero experience and zero other projects listed, but my preference says not to.

# Non-technical Projects
Honestly, I wouldn't know.
If it's something that's grown and succeeded enough to the point where it makes you money, why is it counted as a "Project" and not an "Experience"?
