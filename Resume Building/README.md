# Resume

## What is a Resume?
A single sheet of paper that should get you to the interview.
This piece of paper will get stuffed into folders, cramped among thousands of other resumes, only to be glanced at for maybe 15 seconds, if you're lucky.
First impressions matter incredibly here, so you're going to want to be impactful and be concise.

Lots of companies nowadays use resume parsing software which extracts information, which means conforming to normal formatting is the way that you want to proceed.
